# AI-Driven-Automated-Selection-of-Job-Fit-Candidates-using-PJFNN-and-OCR
Using state-of-the-art Neural Networks for matching job profiles with candidates

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the technology selection for AI-driven automated selection of job-fit candidates using PJFNN (Person-Job Fit Neural Network) and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). We will discuss the rationale behind choosing this technology, its benefits, drawbacks, and the challenges associated with its implementation. Furthermore, a working example will be presented to demonstrate the functionality and potential of this project.

## Technology Selection
Traditional recruitment processes often suffer from subjective biases, time-consuming manual efforts, and limited scalability. By harnessing the power of PJFNN and OCR, we aim to automate the candidate selection process and improve the accuracy of job-fit assessments.

## Benefits
●	Enhanced Efficiency: OCR eliminates the need for manual data entry.
●	Improved Accuracy: PJFNN gives more precise candidate evaluations.
●	Cost Reduction: Automation reduces the time and resources spent on manual screening.

## Drawbacks
●	Resume Quality Dependency: The accuracy relies on the quality of the resumes provided.
●	Potential Bias: May inadvertently introduce bias based on gender, race, or background.

## Challenges
●	Data Quality and Availability: Acquiring high-quality and diverse datasets for training and testing the model poses a challenge.
●	Interpretability and Explainability: Ensuring transparency and accountability may require additional efforts.

## Working Example
Our project involves developing an end-to-end system that utilizes OCR to extract text from PDF resumes. This extracted information is then fed into the PJFNN model, which matches the candidate's skills and experiences with job requirements. The system generates a match score, indicating the level of compatibility between the candidate and the job profile. This approach enables recruiters to efficiently identify and shortlist candidates who closely align with the desired qualifications, streamlining the recruitment process.
